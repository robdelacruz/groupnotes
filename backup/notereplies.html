Sierra On-Line

Founded by Ken Williams and his wife, Roberta, Sierra was a pioneer in early
computer gaming. It produced such classic series' as Police Quest, Space Quest,
King's Quest, Liesure Suit Larry, Quest for Glory, The Incredible Machine,
Hoyle: Book of Cards, and Gabriel Knight. They also were responsible for other
great games such as Outpost, Betrayal at Krondor, Gobliiins, and more.

Sierra went downhill when Ken Williams sold the company and stepped down as
CEO. Since then, the new Sierra Online has become more of a publisher of other
people's games and is more concerned with a large profit margin instead of
delivering excellent games.
