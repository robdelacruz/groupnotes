    <p>Founded by Ken Williams and his wife, Roberta, Sierra was a pioneer in early computer gaming. It produced such classic series' as Police Quest, Space Quest, King's Quest, Liesure Suit Larry, Quest for Glory, The Incredible Machine, Hoyle: Book of Cards, and Gabriel Knight. They also were responsible for other great games such as Outpost, Betrayal at Krondor, Gobliiins, and more.</p>
    <p>Sierra went downhill when Ken Williams sold the company and stepped down as CEO. Since then, the new Sierra Online has become more of a publisher of other people's games and is more concerned with a large profit margin instead of delivering excellent games.</p>
