notes - Inspired by PLATO Notes.

Every note or response appeared on its own screen. Since PLATO was designed for education, its architecture was biased toward carefully crafted full-screen displays. It was easy to place text or graphics at specific locations on the screen, but nearly impossible to scroll text. For Notes, this was both an advantage and a drawback. One nice feature was that the note title, date, time, and author's name always appeared in the same place. After using Notes for a while, your eye "knew" exactly where to look for these things.

On the down side, each posting was limited to 20 lines of text so as to fit on one screen. The only way to overcome this was to write a series of responses, but that allowed other responders to slip in and disrupt the flow. Still, the 20-line limit had the virtue of encouraging brevity.

Most options for reading notes required only a single keypress. While reading a response, for example, one keypress could perform any of these functions (among others):

proceed to the next response
go back to the previous response
go back to the base note
skip to the next base note
begin writing a new response
There were too many options to list them all on every screen. Most prompts were quite minimal, but a Help key was universally available. It would display a complete list of the options available at any point.
